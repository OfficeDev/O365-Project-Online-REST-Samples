# Project ReST Basic Operations

The Project ReST Basic Operations demonstrates how to create and update a project using ReST API

###Prerequisites
To use this Project Online ReST code sample, you need the following:
* An Office 365 tenant with a Project license
* Project CSOM client library.  It is available as a Nuget Package from [here](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.SharePointOnline.CSOM/)
* PowerShell v4.0

###Modules
* [CreateProject](/createproject.ps1)
* [UpdateProject](/updateproject.ps1)
* [UpdateProjectCustomFields](/updateprojectcustomfieldvalues.ps1)

##How the sample affects your tenant data
This sample runs ReST API methods that create, read, update, or delete data. When running commands that delete or edit data, the sample creates sample data. The sample data is created or edited so that your actual tenant data is unaffected.
